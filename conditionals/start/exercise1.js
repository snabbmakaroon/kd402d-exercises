// Exercise 1: store a yes/no fact
// Each exercise has its own file and its own button on the page. Do them in order:
// exercise1.js, exercise2.js, and so on. After each one: save, press its button, check the console, commit.
// bass and synth, the instruments, are made in setup.js.
//
// Today every exercise keeps its variables inside its own function. That way they don't clash
// with the variables in demos.js and song.js, which use some of the same names.
